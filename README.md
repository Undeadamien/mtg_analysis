# Exploratory analysis of Magic the Gathering

Data analysis on different datasets which can be found at https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/

- allprints: contains information on all printed cards and their variations
- allsets: contains information on all sets of cards
- alldecks: all decks: contains information on all decks officially released

I'm still working to add new graphics
